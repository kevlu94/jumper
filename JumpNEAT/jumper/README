NOTE:
The learner contantly updates the file "output.txt" with the best list of torques found. You can run "make jump", which reads in the "output.txt" as input torques, anytime while the learner is running, or whenever an "output.txt" file exists.

You can try running the following:
./jumper stand.txt
"stand.txt" was produced by an overnight learning session, learning how to balance.
